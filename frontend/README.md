# BOT-O-MAT Frontend

This app manages bots with the intention to execute specific tasks. These tasks could be loaded from a reducer constant or through an API call. If you are using the API, just make sure it is up and running and then set the [REACT_APP_IS_API_ACTIVE](/.env.development) env variable to `true`.
